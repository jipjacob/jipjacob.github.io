## The Person Behind the Random Knowledge

Hey! I'm Jip, and if you've somehow landed here, you're probably wondering who's responsible for this digital mishmash of articles and projects.

## The Professional Stuff (But Not Too Much)

In my day job, I work as an AI engineer, building smart things for other people. But that's just how I pay the bills. This site exists because there are too many other things bouncing around in my head that have nothing to do with my LinkedIn profile.

## What I'm Actually Into

I'm that person who falls down random rabbit holes at 2 AM. One minute I'm comparing frame rates in World of Warcraft across different Mac models, and the next I'm testing every card sleeve on the market to find the perfect protection for my One Piece TCG collection.

Tech, gaming, programming side projects, and occasionally hacking my own home systems (looking at you, Enphase solar panels) – if it's slightly nerdy and completely optional to everyday life, I'm probably into it.

## Why This Site Exists

I created this space because:

1. My friends were tired of me texting them "Did you know..." messages at midnight
2. I figure someone out there might actually find this stuff useful
3. I needed somewhere to document my projects before I inevitably forget how I built them

## What You'll Find Here

No content schedule. No niche focus. Just honest write-ups about things I care about when I have time to write them. Sometimes I'll go deep on technical details; other times, I'll just tell you what worked for me so you don't have to spend 17 hours figuring it out yourself.

## What's Next

I'm currently obsessed with building an app for the One Piece TCG and finding ways to incorporate AI that actually makes it better, not just more complicated. Beyond that? Who knows – that's part of the fun.

When I'm not coding or writing articles, you'll find me [personal detail - like "destroying friends at game night" or "perfecting my coffee brewing technique"].

Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet. Make yourself at home, and don't hesitate to reach out once I finally get around to building that contact page.
