By day, I work as an AI engineer, but this site isn't about my job—it's about everything else that keeps me up at night. Like, did you know that MacBook Pros and Mac Studios handle World of Warcraft totally differently? Or that there's a whole science to picking the right sleeves for your trading card games? Yeah, that's the kind of random knowledge you'll find here.

I jump between topics faster than my cat chases laser pointers. One day I might be writing about how to hack your Enphase solar panel system, and the next I could be deep-diving into gaming performance metrics. There's no method to the madness—just stuff I find interesting and figure someone else might too.

When I'm not writing articles, I'm usually tinkering with projects—currently obsessing over programming the One Piece TCG and building an app that does some cool AI things (okay, so maybe a little of my day job sneaks in here).

Feel free to poke around, read whatever catches your eye, or just judge my weird combination of interests. I'm still putting this place together, so the contact page is coming soon™.

Fresh articles below—no subscription required, just pure, unfiltered thoughts from my brain to yours.
